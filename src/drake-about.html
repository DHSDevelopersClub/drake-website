      <h1>Drake</h1>
      <p>Sir Francis Drake High School: Situated on a 21 acre campus, Drake High School is traversed by two year-round creeks. Drake
      was the District’s second high school to open in 1951 and is located in the Ross Valley, Marin County serving the West Marin
      communities, Fairfax and San Anselmo. Drake High School has over 1,100 students enrolled in an academically rigorous and
      innovative curricular program. Sir Francis Drake was a part of a systematic change movement in the 1990’s to provide small learning
      communities (SLCs) for our 9
      th and 10th grade students.</p> <p>We continue this tradition in order to provide a personalized academic and
      social/emotional approach to learning. All students are placed in one of our three SLCs to receive parts of their core academic
      education. Much of our educational approach involves both a curricular integration of curriculum and project-based learning. Drake
      High also offers two integrated Academies for students in their junior and senior year who are interested in communication
      (ComAcad) or environmental studies (SEA-DISC).</p> <p>Drake is also proud to offer a four-year Engineering program, Peer Resource,
      numerous elective course offerings and 13 AP courses. 85% of Drake students scored a 3 or higher on the AP tests taken in the past
      year. Currently, 88% of Drake students attend college and 80% of our students are UC/CSU eligible.
      Course Offerings: Drake’s curriculum emphasizes a college preparatory program but provides for all levels of ability and interest.
      Course offerings range from Advanced Placement and Honors classes to academic support for those who need extra help. Eleventh
      and 12th grade students may choose a traditional curriculum or an integrated, project-based program. The project-based programs are
      two-year, blended 11th and 12 graders, in two academies – Communications and Environmental Studies.
      <p>Extracurricular Program: At Drake High we believe in a strong connection between a student’s activities/athletics program and a
      student’s academic success. Athletic teams for girls and boys include soccer, volleyball, football, tennis, water polo, cross-country,
      basketball, wrestling, track and field, softball, baseball, swimming and diving, golf, lacrosse, mountain biking and sailing. Dance team
      adds to the great spirit at Drake and an active student government provides a variety of student programs and activities as well as
      service to the community. Students pursue individual interests in many organized clubs and internships.</p>

      <h1>CAASPP</h1>
      <p>Last spring, the state implemented a new standardized assessment system as
      part of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC). This new
      system, known as the California Assessment of Student Performance and
      Progress (CAASPP), includes computer-based tests of student achievement in
      English language arts/literacy and mathematics (Smarter Balanced) and a
      California Standards Test (CST) for Life Science. The Smarter Balanced tests
      replace the former paper-based assessment system that included the Standards
      Testing and Reporting (STAR) tests.</p>

      <p>The new assessment system is designed to measure student progress and
      proficiency on California’s new academic standards (Common Core), which are
      designed to help all students graduate ready to pursue a career or attend
      college. The Smarter Balanced tests include a wider variety of question types
      than STAR tests, including items that ask students to solve problems, think
      critically, and write analytically.</p>

      <p>While the CAASPP tests are just one gauge of student progress towards
      achievement on the state standards, they will provide us valuable data. This
      year, the data provides a baseline for measuring student progress and
      proficiency. We are not able to compare these results to any previous
      assessment results, as CAASPP and STAR tests did not assess the same
      learning goals.</p>

      <p>The Smarter Balanced assessment results are reported in 4 achievement levels:
      standard exceeded, standard met, standard nearly met, and standard not
      met. Furthermore, student scores are disaggregated by area within English
      language arts and mathematics. In the English language arts test there are 4
      areas: reading, writing, listening and research/inquiry. Mathematics has 3 areas:
      problem solving, modeling/data analysis, concepts procedures, and
      communicating reasoning. The areas data may assist students in identifying
      appropriate course work for their senior year in order to achieve college and
      career readiness upon graduation.</p>
